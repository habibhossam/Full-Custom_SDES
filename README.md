This is my project of S-DES for the course Advanced Full Custom VLSI 


This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Simplified Data Encryption Standard (S-DES) algorithm, which is a scaled-down version of the original DES algorithm. The scope of this project includes the following:

1. Behavioral-level design and simulation of the S-DES algorithm, including the encryption and decryption processes.
2. Schematic-level design and simulation of the S-DES subsystems, such as the key generator, Feistel function, and permutation blocks.
3. Layout design, including floorplanning, placement, routing, and verification (DRC and LVS).
4. Performance evaluation of the S-DES design in terms of area, power, and throughput, and comparison with the initial estimates.
5. Proposal of appropriate testing methodologies for the S-DES design, including testbench development and fault modelling.
